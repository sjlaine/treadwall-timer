# GP-81 Treadwall Timer

This project is a timer app made for the GP81 climbing gym in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.
It allows users to make custom interval timers, by selecting route colors and
specifying the duration of intervals as well as the number of repeats for each interval.
It also has stopwatch and standalone timer options. Timer functions are achieved
with the help of the EasyTimer.js library.
